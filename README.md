Warning: Do not run this program without reading it first. It can delete files from your computer and can also make your keyboard behave abnormally.

This program is an experiment in automating tasks. It accesses the Scryfall API to get data, and then types that data in a format that is appropriate for Magic Set Editor (https://github.com/twanvl/MagicSetEditor2).
